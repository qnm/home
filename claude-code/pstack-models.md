# pstack model configuration

Per-role model overrides for pstack skills. Each pstack SKILL.md names its defaults in a Models section; the values here override those defaults. Delete a line to fall back to the skill default. A value of `inherit-parent` or `auto` runs that role on the parent session's model (the `Agent` call omits `model`); an alias entry in a panel list still counts toward that panel's fan-out. `session hook: off` stops the Claude Code SessionStart hook from injecting the poteto-mode mandate; any other value, or no line, leaves it on.
